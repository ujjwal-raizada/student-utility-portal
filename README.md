## Contributing

We love contributions. That out of the way, an average
contribution would involve the following:

1. Fork this repository in your account.
2. Clone it on your local machine.
3. Add a new remote using `git remote add upstream https://github.com/ujjwalrox/student-utility-portal.git`.
4. Create a new feature branch with `git checkout -b my-feature`.
5. Make your changes.
6. Commit your changes.
7. Rebase your commits with `upstream/master`:
  - `git checkout master`
  - `git fetch upstream master`
  - `git reset --hard FETCH_HEAD`
  - `git checkout my-feature`
  - `git rebase master`
8. Resolve any merge conflicts, and then push the branch with `git push origin my-feature`.
9. Create a Pull Request detailing the changes you made and wait for review/merge.

It might seem a little complicated at a glance, but the fundamental concept is simple: we
want to ensure that your changes are always made on top of the latest changes to the
project and thus, we can easily merge your code.

### Commit Message Guidelines

The commit message:

- is written in the imperative (e.g., "Fix ...", "Add ...")
- is kept short, while concisely explaining what the commit does.
- is clear about what part of the code is affected -- often by prefixing with the name of the subsystem and a colon, like "server: ..." or "docs: ...".
- is a complete sentence, ending with a period.
